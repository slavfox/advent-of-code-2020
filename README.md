# A very patient Advent of Code 2020

Doing this year in Prolog! Expect slowness.

Usually, files called `part1.pl` and `part2.pl` contain just the code that reads
a file and writes out the answer. If there's a solution for both parts, it will
be in a file called both.pl.

You'll need SWI Prolog. Run each day's solution by doing
```
Welcome to fish, the friendly interactive shell
Type help for instructions on how to use fish
you@hostname ~> 1/
you@hostname ~> swipl part1.pl input.txt  # ditto for part 2, 3, etc...
```
Fish is the best shell btw.
